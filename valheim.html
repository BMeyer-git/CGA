                <p class="game-description">Valheim, a newer sandbox game set in a viking mythos setting. Players control deceased vikings in a sort of limbo state, and are tasked with destroying mythical "boss" creatures. As a true sandbox, the player can take their time, and are not required to defeat any bosses to have fun in the game, but there are some stages of progression that are locked behind defeating bosses. For example, the first boss drops an antler which can be used to make a pickaxe, which allows the player to break stones and collect ores for better tools and equipment. Each boss also provides the player's viking with a special ability, one of which can be used at any time. Each one (at the time of writing) lasts for 5 minutes and has a cooldown length of 20 minutes. The abilities can vary from buffs that reduce stamina costs for actions, to direct manipulation of the winds to sail with ease. This game's combat can be slightly lacking in comparsion to most action RPGs, but in the realm of sandboxes it has one of the more robust building systems. Player can build viking fortresses of great stature and order with the snapping system, or ignore it to create complicated structures out of many small, overlapping pieces. The buildings are also subject to a support and weight system so structures will naturally be built with considerations for stability, which adds another layer to building projects and even drives the look of many structures.</p>
