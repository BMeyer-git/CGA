                <p>Games often have to build up in intensity to provide a challenge for a player, bigger and better obstacles to surpass force players to hone their skills and give them goals to overcome. For the classic Mario, the goal is to rescue the princess. In order to do so, he must defeat Bowser, a gargantuan creature with terrifying fiery breath and a tough outer shell. Bowser is an example of a "boss," these entities come in all shapes and sizes, but they often serve as the final challenge, or specific checkpoints that a player is to overcome. In games with multiple bosses, defeating one can reward the player with higher scores, resources, unlockables, or abilities.</p>
