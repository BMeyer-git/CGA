                <p>Many games have the player directly controlling either one or multiple "characters," which serve as the agents in the game, or entities that act upon the objectives and obstacles in a game. An example of a character would be Mario, or a basketball player, or even the soldiers in a strategy game. The character is usually manipulated via a controller, which can range from a joystick with a button to a motion controller such as a Wii remote, or even select keys on a keyboard and inputs form a mouse. Players string inputs on these devices together to influence the digital world on the screen before them. For example, if the right arrow key translates to a character taking a step to the right, and the spacebar translates to the character punching whatever is in front of them, a player could press the right arrow twice to take two steps, and then press spacebar to punch something that is now directly in front of the character. As players continue to carefully input these actions, they will build up muscle memory to the point where all they have to think is, "I want to walk over there and punch that guy," and their hands will make adjustments in their character's path until they have, as desired, punched the other guy. The character on screen becomes an extension of the player's body via the controller or human interface device. Many games will use similar control schemes which allows the muscle memory in other games to be applied to new games, even if the player hasn't played it before.</p>
