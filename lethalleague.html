            <p>Baseball is a time-honored sport, but what happens if you replace the baseball with an anti-gravity baseball that is immune to drag force and instead of trying to keep the other players from catching the ball, you're trying to hit them with it? This is the basis of Lethal League, a unique twist of the fighting game genre, that is as much about luck as it is about keeping your cool and predicting the trajectory of a ball at high speeds. It can be played with up to four people, in free-for-all and team-based combat. Each game starts with each player having a set number of lives, and each round ends with one survivor (or team of survivors). Whichever player (or players) remains after all the other player's lives have been exhausted wins. Each hit to the ball will increase its speed, with some types of moves even doubling its speed. It can continue to gain speed until it reaches a max of one million mph, although it takes a good deal of skill to avoid being hit long enough to get it up to that speed. Each character has slightly different mobility levels, (some can jump higher or cling to walls) and they can hit the ball at slightly different angles. After hitting the ball four times in a row, each character can activate a special ability that can be used to further mix up the game. As the ball picks up speed, each round will grow in intensity and reaction times will have to increase to keep up. The best part is that the controls are simple enough that anyone could pick it up and start really getting the game down within an hour. Because the ball can move so fast and is so unforgiving, a novice could defeat a pro with enough practice. Much like the game of tennis, I find myself just wanting to see how many rallies in a row I can rack up, rather than actually winning the fight. To add to the enjoyment of the game, it has a wonderful soundtrack that matches the theme and energy of the game, and the sound design in general makes for some really satisfying games with friends.</p>
