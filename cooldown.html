                <p>Players have standard actions they can usually always perform, walking, jumping, looking around. There is no limit to how often they can do these things. In addition to these basic actions, they might have abilities, such as a more powerful attack, or the ability to leap greater distances, or perform any other great feat. Games often impose limits on these kind of abilities through the use of cooldowns, set lengths of time that "lock" an ability until it can be used again. Cooldown lengths often vary according to the strength of an ability. An ability that essentially serves as a slightly empowered attack might only have a cooldown time of 5 seconds, or a <a href="health.html">health</a> restoring ability might be short, but longer than an attack, usable every 15 seconds, whereas an "ultimate" ability such as one that allows one to cheat death, or deal a great amount of death could be 60 seconds or even longer.</p>
