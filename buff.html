                <p>A temporary effect that increases the power, resilience, or general performance of a <a href="character.html">character</a>. An example of a buff would be an energy shield projected around a character, protecting them from harm and allowing them to endure greater damage than they would without it. In classic games these are often seen in the form of power-ups, such as the power pellet from Pac-Man. Picking up the power pellet gives Pac-Man a “buff” that gives him invulnerability, as well as the power to eat ghosts. These come in all forms, from damage output and speed increases to any sort of measurable enhancement imaginable. Inclusion of buffs in a game can allow skilled players to try and acquire many of them at a time for an edge in the game, against players or AI controlled opponents.</p>
