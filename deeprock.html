                <p class="game-description">Danger, darkness, dwarves! Deep Rock Galactic is the biggest mining corporation on planet Hoxxes IV. They deploy teams of up to four dwarves to carry out the most dangerous missions and pay them handsomely for each glyphid slain and ore mined. Deep Rock Galactic is all about teamwork, but can be played alone if necessary or desired. Players will progress by unlocking new weapons, upgrades, and cosmetics for their dwarf to make each mission more manageable and to distinguish themselves as a dwarf of high standing. There are a few DLCs available to show your support for the developers, obtaining unique cosmetic items in return. All other content in the game, most importantly the upgrades that give your dwarf an advantage, are available to unlock only through progressing through levels and mining enough gold to afford them. Each cave is procedurally generated and fully-destructible, so no mission will ever be the same. In addition to this, various modifiers can affect the types and frequency of glyphids encountered on a mission. To add to the levels of replayability, there are many different mission types. You aren't always mining gold! As an employee at Deep Rock Galactic, you could be laying down pipelines one day, and killing a massive glyphid dreadnaught the next!</p>
