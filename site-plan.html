      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been bored and unsure of what to do? For as many video games as we play in our day to day lives, we often have trouble discovering more or even have trouble explaining and sharing them with others. I plan to create a website that lists and explains particularly good games from various genres. It will contain media links to accurately depict what playing that specific game is like and what it offers. One unique point of this website is that it will contain information that spans multiple sources and compiles them conveniently, alongside my own writing on the less obvious aspects of games, and definitions for game-specific jargon. The goal here is to create an interesting and helpful source that can be used by both those well acquainted with video games and those who are not.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website's intended audience is those who want to learn more about videogames in general, those who are looking for new games to play, or those who want to learn more about specific games. Efforts will be made to define terms and jargon specific to games and gaming in general. While those with a particular interest in games will more easily gain entertainment and fulfillment from browsing, even those without interest in games will be able to experience different worlds or concepts through reading about the games or their various mechanics.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Definitions</h3>
      <p>
        Aggro - Aggro is a term used to describe the attention of enemies in a videogame. I like to think of it as a shortened word for aggression. To take the aggro means to "draw the ire" of an enemy, meaning they would target whoever took aggro. How this is accomplished varies from game to game, but generally whoever does the most damage or whoever attacked the enemy first will get the aggro. It is possible to shift aggro in some games. In games where characters are more specialized in their roles, usually the tank, or player who can withstand the most damage, will prioritize the aggro, so the players/characters with less health can contribute in their own ways without dying.

        Lives/Health - Most games have a life or health system, an allowance of how many mistakes can be made in the game before the "game over." Classic games tend towards a life system, where most mistakes will instantly kill the character, subtract a life, and resume gameplay, usually at a checkpoint. Health can usually be tracked in larger units, percentages, or even discrete chunks. As long as it doesn't reach zero, the player is usually free to play as normal, and there is often a way to replenish lost health. This is more common in modern games and it helps to keep the flow of gameplay going in spite of mistakes, and even allows for games to be less forgiving with penalties, because there is no forced restart after a single slip-up. 

        Character - Many games have the player directly controlling either one or multiple "characters," which serve as the agents in the game, or entities that act upon the objectives and obstacles in a game. An example of a character would be Mario, or a basketball player, or even the soldiers in a strategy game. The character is usually manipulated via a controller, which can range from a joystick with a button to a motion controller such as a Wii remote, or even select keys on a keyboard and inputs form a mouse. Players string inputs on these devices together to influence the digital world on the screen before them. For example, if the right arrow key translates to a character taking a step to the right, and the spacebar translates to the character punching whatever is in front of them, a player could press the right arrow twice to take two steps, and then press spacebar to punch something that is now directly in front of the character. As players continue to carefully input these actions, they will build up muscle memory to the point where all they have to think is, "I want to walk over there and punch that guy," and their hands will make adjustments in their character's path until they have, as desired, punched the other guy. The characcter on screen becomes an extension of the player's body via the controller or human interface device. Many games will use similar control schemes which allows the muscle memory in other games to be applied to new games, even if the player hasn't played it before.

        Boss - Games often have to build up in intensity to provide a challenge for a player, bigger and better obstacles to surpass force players to hone their skills and give them goals to overcome. For the classic Mario, the goal is to rescue the princess. In order to do so, he must defeat Bowser, a gargantuan creature with terrifying fiery breath and a tough outer shell. Bowser is an example of a "boss," these entities come in all shapes and sizes, but they often serve as the final challenge, or specific checkpoints that a player is to overcome. In games with multiple bosses, defeating one can reward the player with higher scores, resources, unlockables, or abilities.

        Cooldown - Players have standard actions they can usually always perform, walking, jumping, looking around. There is no limit to how often they can do these things. In addition to these basic actions, they might have abilities, such as a more powerful attack, or the ability to leap greater distances, or perform any other great feat. Games often impose limits on these kind of abilities through the use of cooldowns, set lengths of time that "lock" an ability until it can be used again. Cooldown lengths often vary according to the strength of an ability. An ability that essentially serves as a slightly empowered attack might only have a cooldown time of 5 seconds, whereas an "ultimate" ability such as one that allows one to cheat death, or deal a great amount of death could be 60 seconds or even longer.

        Buff – A temporary effect that increases the power, resilience, or general performance of a character. An example of a buff would be an energy shield projected around a character, protecting them from harm and allowing them to endure greater damage than they would without it. In classic games these are often seen in the form of power-ups, such as the power pellet from Pac-Man. Picking up the power pellet gives Pac-Man a “buff” that gives him invulnerability, as well as the power to eat ghosts. These come in all forms, from damage output and speed increases to any sort of measurable enhancement imaginable. Inclusion of buffs in a game can allow skilled players to try and acquire many of them at a time for an edge in the game, against players or AI controlled opponents.
          
        Debuff—The opposite of a buff, see Buff for more information. An example would be the effect Pac-Man’s power pellet has on ghosts: They move slower and are vulnerable to being eaten. These usually come in the form of slowing, weakening, or otherwise hampering a character. Piling debuffs on a character can help to overcome their strengths or really capitalize on their weaknesses, such as a slowing debuff on a normally exceptionally fast character, or a debuff that makes a weak character even more vulnerable to damage.

      <h3>Games</h3>
      <p>
        Lethal League
        Genre: Fighting game
        Baseball is a time-honored sport, but what happens if you replace the baseball with an anti-gravity baseball that is immune to drag force and instead of trying to keep the other players from catching the ball, you're trying to hit them with it? This is the basis of Lethal League, a unique twist of the fighting game genre, that is as much about luck as it is about keeping your cool and predicting the trajectory of a ball at high speeds. It can be played with up to four people, in free-for-all and team-based combat. Each game starts with each player having a set number of lives, and each round ends with one survivor (or team of survivors). Whichever player (or players) remains after all the other player's lives have been exhausted wins. Each hit to the ball will increase its speed, with some types of moves even doubling its speed. It can continue to gain speed until it reaches a max of one million mph, although it takes a good deal of skill to avoid being hit long enough to get it up to that speed. Each character has slightly different mobility levels, (some can jump higher or cling to walls) and they can hit the ball at slightly different angles. After hitting the ball four times in a row, each character can activate a special ability that can be used to further mix up the game. As the ball picks up speed, each round will grow in intensity and reaction times will have to increase to keep up. The best part is that the controls are simple enough that anyone could pick it up and start really getting the game down within an hour. Because the ball can move so fast and is so unforgiving, a novice could defeat a pro with enough practice. Much like the game of tennis, I find myself just wanting to see how many rallies in a row I can rack up, rather than actually winning the fight. To add to the enjoyment of the game, it has a wonderful soundtrack that matches the theme and energy of the game, and the sound design in general makes for some really satisfying games with friends. 

        Valheim
        Genre: Sandbox Survival game
        Valheim, a newer sandbox game set in a viking mythos setting. Players control deceased vikings in a sort of limbo state, and are tasked with destroying mythical "boss" creatures. As a true sandbox, the player can take their time, and are not required to defeat any bosses to have fun in the game, but there are some stages of progression that are locked behind defeating bosses. For example, the first boss drops an antler which can be used to make a pickaxe, which allows the player to break stones and collect ores for better tools and equipment. Each boss also provides the player's viking with a special ability, one of which can be used at any time. Each one (at the time of writing) lasts for 5 minutes and has a cooldown length of 20 minutes. The abilities can vary from buffs that reduce stamina costs for actions, to direct manipulation of the winds to sail with ease. This game's combat can be slightly lacking in comparsion to most action RPGs, but in the realm of sandboxes it has one of the more robust building systems. Player can build viking fortresses of great stature and order with the snapping system, or ignore it to create complicated structures out of many small, overlapping pieces. The buildings are also subject to a support and weight system so structures will naturally be built with considerations for stability, which adds another layer to building projects and even drives the look of many structures.
